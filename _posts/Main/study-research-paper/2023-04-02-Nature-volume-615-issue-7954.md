# Determining the gluonic gravitational form factors of the proton
- **<U>Experimental Particle Physics</U>**

The study focuses on understanding the **gluonic gravitational** form factors of the proton. To understand what this means, it's helpful to first understand some background information about particle physics.

The proton is a subatomic particle that is composed of smaller particles called quarks and gluons. Quarks are held together by gluons, which are the carriers of the strong nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei.

In addition to the strong nuclear force, there are three other fundamental forces in nature: electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and gravity. Electromagnetism is responsible for interactions between charged particles, while weak nuclear force is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay. Gravity is responsible for the attraction between massive objects.

In particle physics, form factors are mathematical functions that describe how a particle interacts with other particles or fields. In the case of the proton, form factors can be used to describe how it interacts with electromagnetic fields (such as those produced by a photon) or gravitational fields (such as those produced by other massive objects).

The researchers in this study were specifically interested in determining the gluonic gravitational form factors of the proton. This refers to how gluons contribute to the gravitational mass of the proton. Gravitational mass is a measure of how much an object responds to a gravitational field - in other words, how much gravity it produces and how much gravity it feels from other objects.
To investigate this phenomenon, the researchers used a small color dipole and threshold photoproduction of the J/ψ particle. A color dipole refers to two quarks that are separated by a distance - this creates an electric dipole moment that can interact with electromagnetic fields. The J/ψ particle is a type of meson that contains one charm quark and one charm anti-quark.

By using these tools, the researchers were able to investigate the gravitational density of gluons. They then analyzed their data using various models and were able to determine the gluonic gravitational form factors of the proton from their measurements.

One interesting finding from this study is that they determined a **mass radius** that is notably smaller than the electric charge radius. This means that there is more mass concentrated in a smaller volume than would be expected based on just looking at the electric charge distribution of the proton.

The researchers used a variety of models to analyze their data, including vector meson dominance (VMD), generalized vector dominance (GVD), and holographic QCD. VMD is a model that describes the interaction between photons and hadrons (particles made up of quarks and gluons). GVD is a more general version of VMD that includes additional mesons. Holographic QCD is a theoretical framework that uses string theory to describe the strong nuclear force.

In all cases, the researchers found that their determined mass radius was smaller than the electric charge radius. This suggests that there is more mass concentrated in a smaller volume than would be expected based on just looking at the electric charge distribution of the proton.

In some cases, depending on the model used, they found that their determined radius agrees well with first-principle predictions from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD is a computational technique used to study the strong nuclear force. It involves discretizing space-time into a lattice and using numerical simulations to calculate properties of particles such as quarks and gluons.

Overall, this research helps us better understand how gluons contribute to the gravitational mass of visible matter. It also has potential applications in fields such as nuclear physics and astrophysics, where understanding these properties can help us better model and predict phenomena such as neutron stars and black holes.

One interesting aspect of this study is that it highlights some of the challenges involved in studying subatomic particles. For example, because quarks are always confined within hadrons like protons, it can be difficult to directly measure their properties. Instead, researchers often have to rely on indirect methods like those used in this study.

Another challenge is that subatomic particles are subject to quantum mechanics, which means that their properties can be described by probability distributions rather than exact values. This can make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from experimental data.
