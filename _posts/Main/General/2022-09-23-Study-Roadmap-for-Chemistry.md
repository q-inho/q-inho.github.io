Working in small groups, students will conduct both literature and experimental research on their chosen topic to evaluate its scientific claims and the public perception to them, under the instructor's supervision. Towards the end of the course, students will write up their findings into a scientific report for professional audience and construct a piece of science communication for laymen audience.
