>This course provides an introduction to industrial engineering and decision analytics (IEDA). It comprises of two parts. The first part introduces basic IE analytical tools, such as optimization, game theory, probability and statistics, at a conceptual level. In the second part, many of the IEDA practical concepts, including production and operations management, logistics and supply chain management, financial technology are introduced.
