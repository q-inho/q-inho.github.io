## Introduction
Full stack web development is building the web from front-end web development to back-end coding with honored skill. Full-stack web developer is responsible for both front-end and back-end including database and debugging of web applications.

### Front-end / Client-side

This is where the provider can deliver the content to the user and client by providing the access to the information in a browser.

These technology are commonly used in front-end
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Back-end / Server-side

The information and contents on the web are supported by back-end support. The communication between the database and the web is developed. Server development is also one of the main responsible for back-end development.

Various technologies are commonly used in back-end
- PHP
- Java
- ASP.NET
- Ruby
- Python

## Three Tier Architecture

![three layer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79438062/152032009-14abe142-6c5c-407c-b28d-c741cad6c4f2.jpg)

Three Tier Architecture is one of the common architecture for information systems from the user interface to persistent storage of data.

### Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer is responsible for concerning and developing the delivery of the contents and the information to the user. The development can be improving the UI(User Interface) that provide interaction between the user and service. UI design is supposed to be visual design including font, colour and layout that the user will see on the web screen.

### Business Logic layer

The Business Logic Layer is responsible for concerning and developing the generation of the content such as data, the data validation, the dynamic content processing that will be delivered to the user.

### Data Access Layer

The Data Access Layer is responsible for concerning and developing the storing and handling the data in form of a database and its access through an API(Application Programming Interface).

### Full Stack JavaScript Development

![JavaScript three layer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79438062/152041918-fd678d86-3098-4034-8403-e24488155e44.jpg)

The Business Logic Layer communicate and interact with the persistent data that is stored in the relational database. Also, it renders information to the front side in form of the server-side. Nowadays, there are increasing trends of using a single language to implement the entire layers. Full Stack JavaScript Development is one example.

1. Present layer commonly uses these for implementation:
- JavaScript Frameworks(libraries)
  * Angular
  * React
- UI Frameworks
  * Bootstrap 4
  * Angular Material

2. Business Logic Layer commonly uses these for implementation:
- NodeJS
  * dependent on JavaScript
- NodeJS Modules
- BaaS

3. Data Access Layer commonly uses these for implementation:
- MongoDB
- JSON documents
  * This format is used for exchange between server-side and front-side.
