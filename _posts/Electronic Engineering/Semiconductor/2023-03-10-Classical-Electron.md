# Background

J. J. Thomson’s 1897 discovery of the electron revealed it as a subatomic particle with a mass of \\(9.1 \times 10^{-31}kg\\) and a charge of \\(-1.6 \times 10^{-19}C\\). The electron is now understood to be a point-particle with no physical size, yet possessing mass, charge and an intrinsic angular momentum known as spin. This post evaluates the implications of the. Electron’s classical charge and mass.
