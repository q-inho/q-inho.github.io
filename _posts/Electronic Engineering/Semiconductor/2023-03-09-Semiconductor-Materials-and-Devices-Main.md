# Overview
Welcome to my ELEC 4510 - Semiconductor Materials and Devices HKUST course study blog. This technical resource contains comprehensive notes and insights on semiconductor materials and devices. Topics include semiconductor crystal growth, electronic structures of atoms and solids, energy band and conduction mechanisms, and junction diode physics. I'll also cover excess carriers, bipolar junction transistors, and MOSFETs.
